<!--Difference between CSS combinators-->
    <h2>Applying different combinators</h2>    
    <div class="descendant">
        <p>This is for Descendant selector</p>
        <p>The descendant selector matched all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>
        <span>This is a span column so styling is not applied on it.</span>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="child">
        <p>This is for child selector</p>
        <p>The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.</p>
        <span>This is a span column so styling is not applied on it.</span>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="adjacent">
        <p>This is for adjacent sibling selector</p>
        <p>The adjacent sibling selector selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.</p>
        <span>This is a span column so styling is not applied on it.</span>

    </div>

    <p>This is a paragraph which is just outside the division so the styling is applied on it.</p>
    <span>But this is not immediately followed.</span>  
    <hr>
    <div class="general">
        <p>This is for General sibling selector</p>
        <p>The general sibling selector selects all elements that are the adjacent siblingsof a specified element</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is the paragraph which is outside the division.</p>
    <p>Same with this!</p>
    <p>So they all are the siblings of division and should have the styling.</p>
